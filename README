DEVICEDETECT v0.9 is a PHP application to detect which Mobile handset and browser is used to view your website page. It uses the detection API from HandsetDetection.com. This script uses CURL instead of PEAR. Should be easy to use. Just signup at handsetdetection.com to get the API Key and replace it in example.php.
